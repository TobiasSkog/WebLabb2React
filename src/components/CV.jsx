              <p>In my role as an instructor at Lernia, teaching CAD for a vocational training program, I had the
                opportunity
                to impart the fundamentals and, to some extent, more advanced features of CAD. This role was particularly
                interesting as it involved working with a completely new CAD program. Adapting lessons to ensure
                understanding for students with varied backgrounds made the work more challenging and engaging.</p>

                an
                ICA store in Bullmark, and I also worked at ICA Maxi during the summers. These experiences provided me
                with
                valuable insights into social competence and customer interaction. Regularly engaging with new people each
                day, I became adept at effective communication.</p>
